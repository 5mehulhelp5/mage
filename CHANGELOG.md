### Added

### Changed

- Renamed option `help` to `--help` or `-h`

  `mage config` will act the same if it has not option set,
  See the docs for whats new or use `mage [--help/-h]`

  this change enhances the efficiency of the process and integrates our specialized logic for an optimized experience

### Fixed

- `mage open admin` case where the default store has a different name than default
- Revert of removal of extra if, for valet in cleanup commit, this trows warning in none valet env's

- `mage new module` command

### Removed

- Disbale hints for add hyva, < Magento 2.4.4
- `mage replaced` command
- `mage devclean` command, we use watch mainly so this only clutter
- simplify purge actions, by removing the c:f action, that is not needed with the manualy action before it
- Command `new translate` and only keep the alias `new i18n` as the new default,
  the `new translate` does not fit and should be `new translation` but I prefer less typing so `new i18n` it is.
