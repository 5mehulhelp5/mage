## [1.11.0] - 2022-08-29 / [1.15.2] - 2023-10-08

### Added

- new alias for `mage devclean` now you can run the same with `mage watch`
- compat-module-fallback support to `mage add hyva` development version
- aliases for composer install, update and remove, so they can be used with valet php version
- Theme switcher to `add hyva` command
- new command `build` to simplify the `setup:static-content:deploy` command
- new command `translate` to add new translations based on your current folder
- `new i18n` command will now sort all translations alphabetically

### Changed

- Renamed option `help` to `--help` or `-h`
- Add 2 new options to `mage config` using flags,
  `mage config` will act the same if it has not option set,
  See the docs for whats new or use `mage [--help/-h]`
- Use disable customer captcha for add hyva by default
- simplify purge actions, for redis-cli under an if statement
- Use en_US nl_NL as default for `build` command, if empty
- Use 4 jobs as default for `build` command, if empty
- Allow `help` and `self-update` command in any folder location, not just the Magento 2 root folder
- `new theme` now works again, using copy by default
- `new module` now replaces the placeholder fields for you
- Revamped the `new i18n` command to use `bin/magento i18n:collect-phrases` while preserving our customized auto output functionality,
  this change enhances the efficiency of the process and integrates our specialized logic for an optimized experience

### Fixed

- `mage open admin` case where the default store has a different name than default
- Revert of removal of extra if, for valet in cleanup commit, this trows warning in none valet env's
- Watch for Warden
- Fixed force in `build` command
- typos in `new module`
- `mage config` overlappping/overriding `mage config:show`
- `mage new module` command

### Removed

- Disbale hints for add hyva, < Magento 2.4.4
- `mage replaced` command
- `mage devclean` command, we use watch mainly so this only clutter
- simplify purge actions, by removing the c:f action, that is not needed with the manualy action before it
- Command `new translate` and only keep the alias `new i18n` as the new default,
  the `new translate` does not fit and should be `new translation` but I prefer less typing so `new i18n` it is.
